# Memento - Visual Memory Test

[Memento](https://andreeeasn.github.io/pp2-memento/) was developed for people interested in testing or improving their visual memory skills through a short and simple browser game.
In this game you'll be given a short timer to remember all highlighted tiles, and then select as many of them as you can recall.
Get 3 incorrect tiles and lose a life, lose 3 lives and you're out.
The levels gradually increase in difficulty, how far can you make it?

# UX

## User Demographic
This website was designed to:
  - Provide a simple browser game for those wanting to test their memory
  - Allow returning users to practice their visual memorization
  - Be quick and accesible enough to be played during shorter breaks/downtime
 
## Design
- As the game revolves around remembering visual patterns, a minimalistic greyscale design was adopted to reduce visual clutter.

- Upon clicking a button or tile their color will change to a darker gray to provide a sense of physicality, as if a button is being pressed.
- The only time more vivid colors are used are light hues of green/red to signal correct/incorrect selections respectively

- Buttons are also styled to resemble the tiles used in-game except with a Font-awesome icon featured on it.
