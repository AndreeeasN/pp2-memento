# Memento - Visual Memory Test

[Memento](https://andreeeasn.github.io/pp2-project/) was developed for people interested in testing or improving their visual memory skills through a short and simple browser game.
In this game you'll be given a short timer to remember all highlighted tiles, and then select as many of them as you can recall.
Get 3 incorrect tiles and lose a life, lose 3 lives and you're out.
The levels gradually increase in difficulty, how far can you make it?
